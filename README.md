# Spectral Computing  
**Logic and Memory in Frequency-Driven Modal Systems**

---

This repository implements a programmable spectral computer prototype, where logic, memory, and control flow are driven entirely by modal interference of frequency-structured waveforms φ(t).

Unlike classical computers based on transistors or quantum computers based on entanglement, spectral computing relies on frequency density, phase control, and waveform locking to encode information and execute logic.

## 🔬 Core Concepts

- **φ(t)**: Modal field constructed from a sum of cos(√λₙ t + θₙ) terms  
- **Δf**: Frequency spacing between modal components determines logic state  
  - Small Δf → Destructive interference → Frozen (logic 0)  
  - Large Δf → Active oscillation → Logic 1  
- **S(t)**: Selector function for IF/LOOP/MUX control  
- **Spectral RAM**: Each memory slot φ_slot[i] is an independently addressable modal channel

## 📁 Features

- ✅ Spectral logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, MUX)  
- ✅ Finite-State Machine (FSM) using modal states  
- ✅ Spectral RAM with addressable slots and WRITE/READ mechanism  
- ✅ Spectral Instruction Language (SIL) compiler from YAML  
- ✅ Time-structured φ_output(t) execution with programmable clock

## 🧪 Experimental Verification

- Reproduces frequency-density phase transitions predicted in Spectral Logic Computing via Frequency-Density Phase Transitions in Noncommutative Modal https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15363265
- Observes logic transitions via variance and spectral entropy of φ(t)
- Confirms freezing behavior for Δf < 0.3 and active states for Δf > 0.5
